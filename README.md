# Hexagon-DNA - PCB and gerber files

These are the gerber and Kicad-Files for the Hexagon-DNA-Lamp. The 3D-Model as well as some pictures can be found on my [printables-project](https://www.printables.com/model/1434750-hexagon-dna-lamp).

As the PCB is within the 10x10cm-boundaries, you can have them manufactured very cheaply from your favorite PCB-manufacturer. You can get them for around 5$ (+shipping), which is supercheap, and the quality is superb.  
However, someone at PCBWay has found my project on printables and contacted me if I was interested in trying out their quality also. As I needed some more PCBs anyways, and I happily aggreed.  
I mean what can I say: It is absolutely impressive how far hobby-level pcb-manufacturing has come. All PCBs, be it from PCBWay other manufacturers were absolutely immmaculate and much nicer as what you get inside of commercial products. For that price ordering PCBs have become as easy as it can get, and you get absolutely superb quality.  

Some closeup-images can be found in [here](/img). The white PCBs are the corrected version which were manufactured by PCBWay. They have the power-pinouts now mirrored, so that JST-XH-Plugs fit the right way around. All of them function perfectly fine, and I like the white as much as the purple ones. I really should try out some other colors next time :) .
