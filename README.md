# Hexagon-DNA - PCB and gerber files

These are the gerber and Kicad-Files for the Hexagon-DNA-Lamp. The 3D-Model as well as some pictures can be found on my [printables-project](https://www.printables.com/model/1434750).

As the PCB is within the 10x10cm-boundaries, you can have them manufactured very cheaply from your favorite PCB-manufacturer. I paid around 5$ (+shipping) for 10 PCBs on JLCPCB, which is supercheap, and the quality is superb.
